## ENKA
ENKA is an app that's designed to promote cultural awareness through food appreciation and storytelling. ENKA lets users get freshly cooked and authentic lunches delivered to them based on the Philippines' rich and diverse culinary culture. Scanning the QR code included with the lunchbox will provide an immersive storytelling experience which engages them with the history of the region the dish is from.

### Installation Guide
Install Node.js, afterwards open a terminal at the project's root-level directory. Run the following `npm i && node index.js` to run the local server. Alternatively, the program was also deployed to Heroku which you can access through this [link](https://glacial-mesa-73388.herokuapp.com/).
